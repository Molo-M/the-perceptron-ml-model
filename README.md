# Data Science’s First Classifier: The Perceptron

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm**, widely regarded as the **first machine learning model**. The Perceptron introduced foundational concepts such as weights, bias, activation functions, and learning from labeled data — principles that remain central to modern **machine learning** and **AI**.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- A clear explanation of how the Perceptron algorithm works
- A step-by-step implementation in Python
- Training and evaluation on:
  - Artificially generated 2D data
  - The classic Iris dataset (for binary classification)

## Contents

- `Perceptron Implementation.ipynb` – Main notebook containing code, visualizations, and explanations
- `example_datset.csv` – Dataset artificially generated using Numpy
- `Data Science Conference Presentation.pptx` - Powerpoint document briefly expanding on the Perceptron
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions

## Requirements

This project uses standard Python libraries. You can install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Disclaimer

Much of the conceptual understanding and inspiration for this project comes from the book
**Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI** by **Anil Ananthaswamy**.
It provided a clear and intuitive foundation for exploring the history and mechanics of the Perceptron.
